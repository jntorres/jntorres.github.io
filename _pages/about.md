I am a PhD student in the Biomedical Informatics program at Stanford University, advised by Dr. Euan Ashley. [Google Scholar]

My research interests lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly in deep learning and their applications to medical data for multi-task and multimodal systems.   I enjoy working with time series and video data, as well investigating various interpretation based methods.

I received my Bachelorâ€™s and Masters degrees at San Diego State University. My undergraduate/graduate research advisors there were Dr. Ricardo Zayas and Dr. Faramarz Valafar.
