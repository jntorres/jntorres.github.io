I am a PhD student in the Biomedical Informatics program at Stanford University, advised by Dr. Euan Ashley. 
 
My PhD research interests lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly in deep learning and their applications to medical data for multi-task and multimodal systems. I enjoy working with time series and video data, as well as investigating various interpretation based methods. My publications can be found [here.](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dxf5O-8AAAAJ&hl=en)
 
I also have intern and industry experience focusing on machine learning applications to natural language processing (Google) and bioinformatics (Sequenom).
 
I received my Bachelorâ€™s and Master's degrees at San Diego State University. My undergraduate/graduate research advisors there were Dr. Ricardo Zayas and Dr. Faramarz Valafar, respectively.
