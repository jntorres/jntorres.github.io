I hold a PhD in Biomedical Informatics from Stanford University, where I was advised by Dr. Euan Ashley. My research focused on artificial intelligence and machine learning, particularly deep learning applications in medical data (structured and unstructured), with an emphasis on multi-task and multimodal systems. I specialized in analyzing time series and video data and developing interpretable AI models to enhance transparency and reliability. My publications can be found [here.](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dxf5O-8AAAAJ&hl=en)

In addition to my academic research, I have industry experience leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning for  cardiac monitoring and diagnostics at iRhythm Technologies, natural language processing at Google, and bioinformatics at Sequenom.
